        <h1>Analysis</h1>

        <h2>Types of Analysis</h2>

        <p>When it comes to reading and breaking down the charts, you need to be able
            to accurately analyze and react to what's happening. You can understand where price is headed more
            accurately by analyzing correctly.</p>

        <p>You're never going to be able to predict exactly where and when the market will move, but with every candle
            that's printed, you're left with clues and pieces that you can read and react to.</p>

        <h3>Fundamental Analysis</h3>

        <p>Fundamental analysis is what you may already know.

            <br>
            <br>

            "Biden threatens for War."

            <br>
            <br>

            You may see this and immediately, all the charts you're watching begin to go crazy. Stocks are flying and
            tanking. This is an example of fundamental analysis.

            Let's say that you're watching the charts and anticipating a move. Fundamental news is something to be
            mindful of because it can cause massive spikes and really make the markets move unexpectedly.
        </p>


        <p>Another example would be the release of a company product. Imagine Apple is announcing the release of new
            Macbooks or the Vision Pro VR goggles. The anticipation to these can cause a stocks price to rise. </p>

        <p>Those are clear examples of fundamental analysis. Once broken down, fundamentals look over general thoughts
            of a company or pair that you're trading from the human perspective.</p>

        <h3>Technical Analysis</h3>

        <p>Technical analysis is more so based off price patterns and history of what's already taken place. You're
            analyzing the charts and making decisions solely on what you can see there. No outside information.

            <br>
            <br>

            When using technical analysis, this is more so where you're drawing zones and using tools on
            <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">Tradingview</a>.

            <br>
            <br>

            Within this course, we're going to be using a mix of both Technical and fundamental analysis. 90% of your
            chart markups will be based off technicals. We'll use fundamentals as an aid. Normally if your technicals
            are on point, the fundamentals will help propel price to where you're anticipating it to go.
