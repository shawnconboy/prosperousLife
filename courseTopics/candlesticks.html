        <h1>Candlesticks</h1>

        <h2>What Are They?</h2>

        <p>A chart can be looked at in many different forms. You can see the normal line chart, candlestick charts,
            renko, and so on. A line chart will show you the general direction a market has gone toward. But you can't
            see the whole history of where price went in detail.</p>

        <p>Candlestick charts show more detail of where price went when looking at the chart. You can look at a chart in
            different times as well. A candlestick shows the high and low points that price reached within that set
            time, as well as where price officially opened and closed.</p>

        <p>Candlesticks are a pretty general topic, but knowing how to read them and see what they're doing and react to
            those actions in the live market will make you more aware as a trader of what's currently going on.</p>
