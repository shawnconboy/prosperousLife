        <h1>Brokers</h1>
        <h2>What is a broker?</h2>

        <p>A broker, when it comes to trading, is basically a bank that allows you to have your own account that you'll
            place your trades from. Your deposits and withdrawls will come from your broker as well.</p>

        <h2>Regulated or Unregulated?</h2>

        <p>The big difference between using a regulated broker or an unregulated broker will be the leverage and whether
            or not one has a specific pair or commodity that you'd want to trade. With that in mind, regulated brokers
            abide by normal US standards. You're capped at 1:50 leverage whereas, when using an unregulated, your max
            leverage is normally 1:500, and some now are giving access to 1:1000 leverage.</p>

        <p>Also, when it comes to regulated vs. unregulated, the way you deposit and withdraw may be different. Most
            unregulated brokers will need to be transfered using bitcoin. On the regulated side, you have the ease of
            making transfers directly from your bank account and/or debit card. It makes the process smoother for sure.
        </p>

        <p>On the unregulated side, those are three that I've used personally. I never had an issue with any of them.
            Some may have higher or smaller depsoit requirements than others.</p>
