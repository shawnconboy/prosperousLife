        <h2>A Little Backstory</h2>

        <p>Welcome. I'd like to personally thank you for taking the time out to check out what I have to say. There's a
            lot of places to learn from. I would suggest finding credible source(s). Not just one place to learn from.
            People explain things differently, and sometimes you can learn a lot more from another person as well.</p>

        <p>That's what learning how to trade was like for me. There were many times where I'd find myself watching
            videos or reading books from so many different sources. All of those played a role in getting my
            understanding and comprehension of the markets to where I am currently. </p>

        <h2>Trading</h2>

        <p>Trading comes in many different forms. You can trade stocks, options, futures, forex, etc… You see where I'm
            getting with this. There are a lot of ways you can flip a dollar, but they all generally follow the same
            principles.</p>

        <p>What I do is trade currencies or indicies through futures. Primarily Nasdaq at this moment.</p>

        <p>That may be a lot of jargan that you don't know about yet, but you will soon.</p>

        <p>With stocks, you have companies like Apple or Google and they have shares that you can buy into their company
            with. Let's say Apple's share price is $200.00 and you decide you want to buy a share. Normally, you need a
            brokerage account(Robinhood, Webull) and you need to have at least $200 in that account.</p>

        <p>When you buy a share, and the share price moves up to $201.00, you now have made $1.00.</p>

        <p>Congratulations. You've taken a trade, made a whole dollar, now you can sell your share back and take the
            profit. It's that simple. You're a full blown trader now!</p>

        <h2>Buying Or Selling</h2>

        <p>What I just explained was the traditional way of how most people think trading or investing in the stock
            market works.</p>

        <p>Did you know that you can also make money if Apple's share price went from $200.00 down to $199.00 as well?
            You can.</p>

        <p>Trading Futures or Forex allows you to directly say “hey. i think the price of this is going to drop”, you
            tap the sell button and when it drops, you profit off the downward move. You can do this with regular
            stocks, it just tends to be a bit more tedious and time consuming and you have to place an options trade
            rather than a normal share position. You see where i'm getting at? It's more of a hassle in a sense.</p>

        <h2>Pips and Ticks</h2>

        <p>A pip is a unit of measurment in the market. If you're trading a currency. Let's use AUD/USD for example.
            This is the Australian Dollar versus the US Dollar. The numbers will look a little different. But, it's
            currently valued at $0.66536. A pip is the increment that price moves. One full pip in this case is price
            going from $0.66536 to $0.66546. One small movement.</p>

        <p>A tick is very similar to a pip, but instead it relates to when you're trading futures. We'll use Nasdaq for
            this example. It's currently at $18,570.75. The tick is measured here in quarters. So for every quarter that
            price moves, you move one tick. If price went from $18,570.75 to $18,571.75, you moved a whole dollar. Being
            four quarters, you moved 4 ticks.</p>

        <p>Trading indices or currencies also allows you to place a particular dollar amount on how much you want to
            value each pip or tick. This is important because it allows you to make way more money off the movements
            rather than normal stocks.</p>

        <p>Futures have set tick values. You choose whether or not you're okay with the tick value each item you decide
            you want to trade.</p>

        <p>Forex, you have lot sizes. No matter what the size of your account may be, you can always trade the smallest
            lot size. Which is normally $0.10 a pip. Which means you can have a 10 pip move and make $1.00 or you can
            have a 10 pip move and make $1,000.00. It all depends on your lot size.</p>

        <h2>Leverage</h2>

        <p>The final topic we're going to discuss is Leverage. Leverage plays a critical role in your trading. Leverage
            is what's going to make the difference in how big of a lot size you can use.</p>

        <p>
            Let's break it down some more. If you have an account with $10.00 in it and you're using a broker that
            offers a 1:50 leverage, that means that you can technically trade as if you had a $500.00 account balance
            instead. Most regulated brokers have a 1:50 leverage. Unregulated on the other hand normally has a 1:500
            leverage. If you go that route, your $10.00 account would be able to trade as if you had $5,000.00 in your
            account instead.
        </p>

        <p>We'll dive deeper into unregulated and regulated brokers in a later section.</p>

        <h2>Outro</h2>

        <p>This was a little bit of information just to get you into the understanding of how the market moves a bit and
            how we as traders can potentially capitalize off these movements. If you're interested still, we're about to
            dive a lot deeper on different topics and show exactly how to navigate and start making trades.</p>
