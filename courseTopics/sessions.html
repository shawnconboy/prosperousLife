        <h2>Four Main Sessions</h2>
        <p>There are four respective trading sessions. You have London, New York, Sydney, and Tokyo.</p>

        <p>You have different trading sessions because we have different regions all around the world. Those regions
            wake up and operate at different times throughout the day.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Overlap</h2>

        <p>Session overlap is about as simple as it sounds. When you have two sessions, we'll use London and New York
            for example. London begins at 2AM and ends at 11AM. New York Starts at 8AM and ends at 5PM. In the time that
            London is active, New York will also be active for some of that duration. That duration is the session
            overlap.</p>

        <p>This is important because when there are traders from both sessions actively trading, you have more volume in
            the markets, making for the stronger pushes that you want to be in.</p>
